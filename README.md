Lobbler is like a scrobbler. My attempt at keeping a last.fm account update to date and providing myself a way to look at my listening habits and history.

**An Update** (2024/06/03): After lots of hacking I've concluded the [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi) too inconsistent to do real time scrobbling without a lot of logic on my end, so we're pulling yesterday's listens and guessing at times you might have played them rather than scrobbling real time plays as they happen.

**A Second Update** (2024/06/05): This turned out to be a good decision, my first day of scrobbling didn't work as no songs were returned as played "Yesterday" most of the day. This is a partial solution to a problem that should be solved at some other level, unlikely to be a good tool for other folks.
