## LOBBLER

Lobbler is like a scrobbler. My attempt at keeping a last.fm account update to date and providing myself a way to look at my listening habits and history.

**An Update**: After lots of hacking I've concluded the [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi) too inconsistent to do real time scrobbling without a lot of logic on my end, so we're pulling yesterday's listens and guessing at times you might have played them rather than scrobbling real time plays as they happen.


# TODO

- [X] ~~Store listens form YT Music~~
- [X] ~~Send listens from YT Music to last.fm~~
- [ ] Users?
